This documentation provides an internal description of the source code used for
the algorithms implemented in this project, including Huffman and
Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) methods. The project is developed in OCaml and includes
various tools for processing and analyzing binary files.

The project consists of the following five executables:

- `compresslzw` and `decompresslzw` for compression and decompression using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm.
- `compresshuffman` and `decompresshuffman` for compression and decompression using the Huffman algorithm.
- A utility program `dumpbits` to display the contents of a file bit by bit.


The project also relies on the use of two internal modules:

- `BitChannel` which allows reading and writing files bit by bit.
- `PriorityQueue` which implements a priority queue using a binary heap.
